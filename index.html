                    <p>Born to two Greek immigrant parents, I have tried to live my life in a way that honors the
                        sacrifices they had to make to give me a chance at a successful life. This has meant living a
                        life filled with generosity, discipline, and hard work. </p>

                    <p>Academically, I graduated from the University of Maryland with degrees in multiple disciplines:
                        Political Science, Communications, and African-American Studies. I also attended graduate
                        school at the University of Louisville in order to work as a teacher in the Kentucky public
                        school system. In every step of my academic life, I held a high GPA and took on leadership
                        roles. </p>

                    <p>In my working life, I have spent a considerable amount of time in public life. I dedicated my
                        early career working with the Department of Veterans Affairs to fix issues facing veterans that
                        dealt with the department. Later, I moved into election system while working with the
                        Department of Elections for Baltimore County (Maryland). Recently, I spent time teaching
                        disadantaged middle school science to 8th graders in Louisville, Kentucky. My efforts earned me
                        a spot and a scholarship with AmeriCorps. </p>

                    <p>Moving forward from my public roles, I am currently a graduate of the George Washington Coding
                        Bootcamp. With the support of my awesome girlfriend Connie, I have been able to take on several
                        coding projects and I have earned several accolades for my work. </p>
